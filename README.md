## 🧠 Dashboard Views & What I Found

### 📉 1. **Finance View**
- **Net Sales**: $3.74B, with a YoY growth of +353.5%
- **Gross Margin %**: 38.08% (improved from 36.49%)
- **Net Profit %**: Dropped to -13.98% — showing operational inefficiency despite sales growth
- **Insight**: Even with strong top-line growth, the **operational expense** severely impacted the net profit. This highlights the need for cost control strategies.

### 📢 3. **Marketing View**
- Product categories like **Notebook, Desktop, Peripherals** led sales volume

### 🚛 4. **Supply Chain View**
